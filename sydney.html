Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>The results show that routes to, from or terminating near the Sydney CBD – including M1 (South), M1 (North) and the A36 – exhibit a higher METR than other routes with peak period travel times up to 1.3 or 1.4 times the best (shortest) travel time. These routes also exhibit the greatest variation in travel times, with the median excess uncertainty ratio (MEUR) – i.e. the ratio of the median variation in travel time to minimum variation in travel time – also highest for the M1 (South), M1 (North) and the A36 routes. For example, the MEUR is 4.1 on the M1 (South) route, 3.2 for the A36 and 2.9 for the M1 (North). Although the two M1 routes show significant congestion they are relatively unimportant for freight activity.</p>

<p>The best travel times travelling from the CBD (Cahill Expressway) to the M2 were at 11pm with a median travel time of just over 6 minutes and the lowest uncertainty were at 4am with an interquartile range of 1.5 minutes. The longest median travel times were at 4pm with a median of 10 minutes and the greatest uncertainty was at 5pm with an interquartile range of over 9 minutes. Delays were more apparent on the Cahill Expressway and in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty travelling from the M2 to the CBD were at 5am with a median travel time of 6 minutes and an interquartile range of less than a minute. The longest median travel times were at 5pm with a median travel time of over 13 minutes and the greatest uncertainty was at 7pm with an interquartile range of just over 30 minutes. Unlike travel out of the CBD (with only one obvious afternoon peak), travel into the CBD had pronounced peaks in both the morning and afternoon. Delays in both peaks were apparent in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel but most pronounced on the Warringah Expressway near Neutral Bay and North Sydney.</p>
