Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>Across Adelaide, most routes have METRs of around 1.1, hence there is little variation between the median travel time and best travel time across the route. Only the A3 (Cross Road) and A14 (Holbrooks Road, Marion Road and Henley Beach Road) routes have METRs of around 1.2, meaning the median travel time is around 20 per cent higher than the best travel time. Routes with relatively high MEURs include the A15, A17 and A3. On theA15, the MEUR is 2.8–2.9 (i.e. nearly three times larger than the minimum travel time variation), on the A17 MEUR is as high as 4.2 and on the A3, the MEUR is 2.4. The Adelaide routes, in contrast to the other capital cities, are predominantly major arterial roads, and thus have greater based levels of uncertainty.</p>

<p>This surface route traverses Adelaide’s eastern suburbs and links Port Road (A7) at West Croydon in the north with the A13 at Darlington in the south. It passes Richmond near the Adelaide Airport and Plympton along the way. The route comprises several different roads including Holbrooks Road, Marion Road and Henley Beach Road.</p>

<p>For southbound trips, the lowest median travel times were 18 minutes at 5am and the least uncertainty were experienced at 10pm with an interquartile range of 7 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were at 5pm with a median of 28 minutes and an interquartile range of 34 minutes. In both morning and afternoon peaks, delays were present near the intersection with Cross Road at Hilton and the early morning and evening peaks saw delays near Sir Donald Bradman Drive at Hilton and also near Port Road.</p>
<p>The shortest median travel time and lowest travel time uncertainty northbound were at 10pm with a median travel time of 18 minutes and an interquartile range of 6.5 minutes. The longest median travel times were 27 minutes experienced in the morning peak at 8am and the greatest travel time uncertainty were in the afternoon peak at 5pm with an interquartile range of 22 minutes. In both morning and afternoon peak periods, delays were generally fairly evenly distributed along the route, but were particularly evident near Sir Donald Bradman Drive.</p>

<p>The best travel times travelling north from Glenelg to Port Road were experienced at midnight with a median travel time of 13 minutes and the lowest uncertainty were at 1am with an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were in the afternoon peak at 6pm with a median of 18 minutes and an interquartile range of 13 minutes. There is also a significant, but less pronounced, morning peak. Delays were somewhat more apparent near the intersection with Sir Donald Bradman Drive at Fulham.</p>
<p>The shortest median travel times southbound on the routes were 13.5 minutes at 4am and the lowest uncertainty were at 3am with an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times were 18 minutes experienced in the afternoon peak at 5pm and the greatest uncertainty was during the afternoon peak at 3pm, with an interquartile range of 14 minutes. Delays were fairly evenly distributed but were particularly evident near Sir Donald Bradman Drive and Grange Road.</p>
<p>The route exhibits significant travel time variability, in both directions, during business hours, presumably due to light vehicle traffic.</p>

The longest median travel times were at 8am with a median of 32 minutes and the greatest uncertainty was at 5pm with an interquartile range of 27 minutes. Delays were more apparent at the beginning of the route.</p>
<p>The best travel times and the lowest uncertainty travelling south were at 3am with a median travel time of 27 minutes and an interquartile range of 9 minutes. The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were, like the reverse direction, experienced in the afternoon peak at 5pm with a median of 34 minutes and an interquartile range of 28 minutes. Delays were again more evident in the southern portions of the route.</p>
<p>This route, like other key routes in Adelaide, exhibits greater travel time uncertainty throughout business hours in both directions. Moreover, the increase in travel time variation is more significant than the increase in median travel times, suggesting that a small but significant proportion of road users experience significant delays on this route.</p>

The longest median travel times were experienced during the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 46 minutes and the greatest uncertainty was at 3pm with an interquartile range of 40 minutes. There was also a smaller increase in travel times in the morning peak. Delays were most apparent on the surface route sections and the northern parts of the Southern Expressway.</p>
