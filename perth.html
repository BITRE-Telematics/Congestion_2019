Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>Across Perth all routes have METRs of around 1.1, hence there is typically around 10 per cent variation between the median travel time and best travel time across each route. Routes 5 and 6, between the CBD and Fremantle (via the Stirling and Canning Highways, respectively), exhibit slightly higher variation. Routes with relatively high MEURs include Route 2 (Mitchell Highway) and Route 3 (Reid Highway). On Route 2 (Mitchell) the MEUR is 2.7 southbound and 4.7 northbound, and on Route 3 (Reid) the MEUR is 2.5 and 2.8 (westbound and eastbound, respectively). In both cases the larger difference between median variation and the minimum travel time variation, is due to there being very little variation in travel time on these routes at non-peak times.</p>

The longest median travel times and the greatest uncertainty were during the morning peak at 7am with a median travel time of 47 minutes and an interquartile range of 32 minutes. There was also a smaller, but still significant, increase in travel time and uncertainty in the afternoon peak. Delays were most apparent in two sections: one near Edgewater (south of Joondalup) and the other near Stirling (closer to the CBD).</p>
<p>The best median travel time travelling north was 24 minutes at 5am and the lowest uncertainty was at 3am with an interquartile range of 2 minutes. The longest median travel times were at 4pm with a median travel time of 34 minutes and the greatest uncertainty was experienced at 5pm with an interquartile range of 23 minutes. Unlike the southbound direction, there was no observable morning peak in northbound journeys, reflecting the significance of this route as a corridor for commuter’s heading south towards the CBD. Congestion was again most apparent near Stirling.</p>
