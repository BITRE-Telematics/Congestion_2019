Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>Across Brisbane, most routes have METRs of around 1.0 or 1.1, meaning there is little variation between the median travel time and best travel time across the route. The principal exceptions are the M3–A3, M7–A7 and Route 2, which have METRs of around 1.2, meaning the median travel time is around 20 per cent higher than the best travel time. Routes with relatively high MEURs include the M3 (South) and Route 2, where the variation in median travel time variation to the minimum variation is between 2.8 and 3.1 on M3 (South) and 2.3-2.6 on Route 2 (i.e. the ratio of the median variation in travel time to minimum variation in travel time). Unlike Sydney and Melbourne, these routes do not directly connect to the CBD.</p>

<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty heading south from the Bruce Highway to the Pacific Motorway were experienced at 4am with a median travel time of 24.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 3 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 3pm with a median of 32 minutes and an interquartile range of 15 minutes. Delays were most severe on the portion of the route south of Old Cleveland Road. There was no distinct morning peak.</p>
<p>The best travel times heading north from the Pacific Motorway to the Bruce Highway were experienced at 7pm with a median travel time of 24 minutes and the least uncertainty were at 4am with an interquartile range of 3 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 36 minutes and an interquartile range of 25 minutes, both of which were more severe than these of the southbound direction. Delays were most severe in the portion of the route north of Nudgee. A milder morning peak saw delays in the southern part of the route.</p>
<p>The afternoon peaks in both directions can be attributed to commuter traffic leaving the inner areas of Brisbane.</p>

<p>The best median travel time heading north from the Logan Motorway to the Pacific Motorway was 6 minutes at 6pm and the least uncertainty were experienced at 3pm with an interquartile range of 1 minute. The longest median travel times were 7 minutes at 11pm and the most uncertainty were experienced in the evening at 9pm with an interquartile range of 3.5 minutes. Speeds were slower and more uncertain at night which may possibly be enforced roadwork speed limits rather than congestion. There was a very mild peak in the morning at 7am but otherwise travel time and uncertainty were stable throughout the day time.</p>
<p>The best median travel times heading south from the Pacific Motorway to the Logan Highway were 6 minutes at 6am and the least uncertain travel times were experienced at 11am with an interquartile range of 1 minute. The longest median travel times and most uncertainty were at 10pm with a median of 7 minutes and an interquartile range of 4 minutes. Like the northbound direction, the elevated travel time and uncertainty at night are likely attributable to night-time road works, otherwise they were stable during the day time.</p>
<p>The best and longest travel time as well as the least and greatest uncertainty of both directions were the same or very similar with only seconds difference.</p>

<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty travelling from Bowen Hills to the Logan Motorway were experienced at 10am with a median travel time of 18.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 5 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 29 minutes and an interquartile range of 48 minutes. The range of variation in the afternoon peak suggests that the route can become very congested. Apart from this period, both travel time and uncertainty were relatively stable throughout the day. Delays were most apparent on the Centenary Highway near where it crosses the Brisbane River.</p>
<p>The best median travel times travelling from the Logan Motorway to Bowen Hills were 19 minutes at 12pm and the least uncertain travel times were experienced at 1am with an interquartile range of 5 minutes. The highest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced in the morning peak at 8am with a median of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 27 minutes. Like the southbound route, the peak of uncertainty was much more prominent than the peak of median travel time. Delays were again most significant on the Centenary Highway near where it crosses the Brisbane River.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest range of variation northbound from the Logan Motorway to Southern Cross Way were experienced at 4am with a median travel time of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 9 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest uncertainty were experienced at 7am in the morning peak with a median of 37 minutes and an interquartile range of 37 minutes. Delays were most apparent on the surface section (Ipswich Road) of this route and the Ipswich Motorway near Oxley.</p>
<p>The best travel times and least uncertainty southbound from Southern Cross Way to the Logan Motorway were at 3am with a median travel time of 26 minutes and an interquartile range of 9 minutes. The longest median travel times and greatest range of variation were experienced in the afternoon peak at 4pm with a median of 37 minutes and an interquartile range of 32 minutes. Congestion was most apparent near Route 2 at Rocklea.</p>
<p>The data exhibits morning and afternoon travel time peaks and uncertainty in both directions. The morning peak is more severe than the afternoon peak northbound to Southern Cross Way, but the opposite is true for the reverse journey. This makes the M7-A7 route one of the most symmetrical routes in this report.</p>

<p>Eastbound from M7/A7 junction to the Gateway Motorway, the best travel times and lowest uncertainty were experienced at 4am with a median travel time of 11 minutes and an interquartile range of nearly 3 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertain travel time were experienced at 8am during the morning peak with a median of 17 minutes and an interquartile range of 16 minutes. There is also a prolonged afternoon peak. Delays were spread relatively evenly along the route but more apparent near the M3.</p>
<p>Westbound from the Gateway Motorway to the M7/A7 junction, the shortest median travel times and least uncertain travel time were at 4am with a median of 12 minutes and an interquartile range of 4 minutes. The longest median travel times and most uncertain travel times were experienced during the afternoon peak with a median of 16 minutes at 5pm and an interquartile range of 16 minutes at 4pm. There was also a similar but less prolonged morning peak in the westbound direction. Again delays were more apparent near the M3 but also near Beaudesert Road in both peaks.</p>
<p>In both directions, average travel times were higher and the variation in travel greater during business hours. However, morning and afternoon peaks were more pronounced on the westbound route to the A7/M7 junction.</p>
