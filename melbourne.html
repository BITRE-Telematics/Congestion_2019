Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>Like Sydney routes, the results show that routes terminating in or near the Melbourne CBD – including M1 (East) and M1 (West) – generally exhibit higher METRs than other routes, with peak period travel times up to 1.2 or 1.3 times the best (shortest) travel time. These routes also exhibit the greatest variation in travel times, with the MEUR – i.e. the ratio of the median variation in travel time to minimum variation in travel time – also highest for the M1 (East), M1 (West), both around 3.5 to 4.0. In contrast, Routes 32, which traverses the metropolitan area (east–west) and through Melbourne CBD, and the M2, which connects the CBD and Melbourne Airport, do not exhibit as much variation in median travel times.</p>

<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty from the City to the Airport were at 5am with a median travel time of 15 minutes and an interquartile range of 73 seconds respectively. The longest median travel times were in the afternoon peak at 5pm, however, this was only 49 seconds (5.6 per cent), longer than the best travel time. Uncertainty was greatest at 10pm with an interquartile range of 6 minutes. This is likely due to imposed roadwork speed limits that were present at some points in 2019. This would not reflect uncertainty experienced by vehicles who would be aware if roadworks were occurring or not on a given day. The greatest uncertainty was at 5pm with an interquartile range of about 6 minutes.</p>
<p>The best travel times and lowest uncertainty from the Airport to the CBD were at 5am with a median travel time of 14.5 minutes and an interquartile range of 73 seconds. The longest median travel times were in the morning peak at 8am, with 2 minutes longer than the best travel time. Uncertainty was greatest at 8am with an interquartile range of 9 minutes. Uncertainty at night also appears to be attributable to roadwork.</p>
<p>In both directions delays were most apparent close to the M1.</p>
